# Introduction
  
  The project is aimed to provide the ease and comfort with which the students can browse the
books available on various sites and can buy the same accordingly. The project deals with
extracting data from various sites through particular tools like web scraping and then filtering all 
the extracted results and showing the best possible results altogether at the same place by one 
click/search. This accounts for the ease with which the students can access search results of 
different sites and comparing them at the same place on the basis of price , reviews , ratings etc 
. This will help students to buy the books at best possible price and ratings . As we know that 
the customers find it convenient to shop online but presence of many websites makes it a bit 
confusing task for the customer to judge. This project aims at resolving this ambiguity
